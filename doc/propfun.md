# [kimmer](https://github.com/babyfish-ct/kimmer/)/[documentation](./README.md)/Draft property vs Draft function

Let's see an immutable interface

```kt
interface Book : Immutable {
    val name: String  // scalar
    val store: BookStore? // association
    val authors: List<Author> // assocaition
}
```

The ksp pre-compiler of kimmer will generate the mutable interface for it
```kt
// This file is generated by ksp
interface BookDraft<T : Book> : Book, Draft<T> {

    override var name: String 

    override var store: BookStore?
    fun store(): BookStoreDraft<out BookStore>

    override var authors: List<Author>
    fun authors(): MutableList<AuthorDraft<out Author>>
}
```

As we can see, "BookDraft" overrides all read-only properties in Book with writable properties. 

In addition, we can also find that Draft generates functions for association properties.

Apart from the obvious that properties can be modified and functions can only take values, what is the difference between Getters of Draft properties and Draft functions?

|     |Draft property Getter | Draft function |
|-----|------|-----|
|Behavior| Get | Get or Create |
|Nullity| Allow null | forbid null |
|Collection Type| List | MutableList |
|Element/Reference Type|Immutable|Draft|

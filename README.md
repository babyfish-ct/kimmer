## 2. kimmer-sql

   SQL DSL for kotlin

   - API perspective:
   
      As static as possible, find problems while compiling, bring kotlin null safety to SQL.
      
   - Functional perspective:
   
      As dynamic as possible, make complex problems easy to solve. Not only dynamic where predicates, but also dynamic table joins. Support Automatic SQL optimization too.
